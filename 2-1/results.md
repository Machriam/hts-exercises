### 2.1.1

1. Prokaryotic DNA is the cytoplasm, eukaryotic in the nucleus. Prokaryotic single, circular chromosome. Eukaryotic multiple linear chromosomes, capped with telomeres. Eukaryotic genomes are wound around histone proteins, prokaryotic is only supercoiled and compacted
2. Differences:
   1. Eukaryotic:
      1. Exons/Introns structure for an encoding gene, intergenetic regions, much junk, in the nucleus transcription and translation in in cytoplasm. 
      2. Multiple possible steps of regulation: Uncoiling DNA and binding transcription factors, when transcribing the RNA, when the transport of RNA to cytoplasm happens, when translation to a protein happens, or after the protien is has been made --> epigenetic/transcriptional/post-transcriptional/translational/post-translational level
   2. Prokaryotic: 
      1. Translation and Transcription almost simultaneously. Control only via regulation of DNA transcription. Because no nucleaus and DNA directly in cytoplasm
3. Transcription vs Translation:
   1. Transcription Steps: Initiation, Elongation, Termination:
      1. Prokaryotes: Promoter region binding without splicing, RNA polymerases synthesizes mRNA from DNA, encounter end Codon
      2. Eukaryotes: RNA polymerase 2 binds to promoter, transcription factors position RNA polymerase, Introns removed via splicing and mRNA produced, ending of transcription via polyadenylation
   2. Translation Steps: Initiation, Elongation, Termination
      1. Eukaryotic: Ribosomal subunit binds to 5' cap of mRNA and initiator tRNA with methionine binds to start codon (AUG), further tRNAs bring amino acids to ribosome based upon mRNA codons and a stop codon signals the end
      2. Prokaryotic starts with Shine-Dalgarno sequence and do largely the same

### 2.1.2

1. Genetic Polymorphism: Variations in DNA sequences common among individuals within a species
   1. Definition:
      1. Different alleles (Alternative versions of a gene) at a specific locus (position) in the genome
      2. SNPs --> Single base changes at a specific position
      3. Indels (Insertions/Deletions) of DNA bases
      4. Copy Number Variations (CNVs) --> differences in number of copies of DNA segment
      5. Microsatellites: Repeated short DNA sequences --> CAG repeats
      6. --> No single form has an advantage or disadvantage in natural selection
   2. Contribution Genetic Diversity:
      1. Adaptation --> natural selection of positive mutations
      2. Increased Variation of genotypic/phenotypic neutral attributes
      3. Heterozygosity --> Multiple alleles at a locus enhances individuals fitness
      4. Cryptic polymorphism: Blood Types
2. Epigenetic regulation: Persistent and heritable changes in gene expression, without modifying the DNA sequence
