1.
	- A shell is a program, where the user can write commands in a text based way. Those commands are then executed by the system the user invoked the shell on
	- Bash is the most common type of shells in the Unix world. Its full name is Bourne again shell and other popular alternatives are dash or zshell
2. 
	- I am currently using WSL on Windows 10 with a Ubuntu guest system. I am writing this text in a markdown file with vim as editor

### 1.1.4

1. For docker they are pretty much essential to me, because I always forget the commands. Bash syntax is easier and you always have man pages or help switches for commands. Those things make cheat sheets a bit redundant for bash commands in my opinion
2. 
	- This is a really ugly [one](https://devhints.io/bash). Complicated stuff like conditions are only briefed mentioned without their caveats (spacing) and easy stuff like echo to prominent.
	- A much better one is this [one](https://github.com/RehanSaeed/Bash-Cheat-Sheet). It mentions the most important and basic use cases when working in a shell and trivial stuff is not drawn out unnecessarly. Echo for example is only used in combination with other commands, which is the most common use case for it
